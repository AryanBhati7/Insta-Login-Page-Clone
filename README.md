## Description 📝

The Instagram Login Page Clone is a static website that replicates the design and layout of the Instagram login page. It aims to provide a similar user experience as the original website, with a clean and responsive interface. 📱💻

## Features 💫

- Login form with email/username and password fields
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Visually appealing layout inspired by Instagram's design

## Getting Started 🚀

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Instagram-Login-Clone
```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage 🔍
